      <H2>Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility</H2>
         <DL>
            <DT>a) This Rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.
            <DT>b) Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility.
            A power driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate maneuver.
            <DT>c) Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying
            with the above Rules
            <DT>d) A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is
            developing or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists
            of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided:
               <DL>
                  <DT>1) An alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken; and
                  <DT>2) An alteration of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam
               </DL>
            <DT>e) Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of
            her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam,
            shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and, in any
            event, navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

<p>True or False.  In the event that the presence of another vessel is
   detected by radar alone, and it is determined that risk of collision
	exists, if an alteration of course is needed in an avoiding action the
	course alteration should be toward a vessel abeam.<p>
